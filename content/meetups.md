We meet in Nelson every **Wednesday from 5:30pm (ish)** at **[Prince Albert](http://theprincealbert.co.nz/)**

**1st Wednesday of each month - Founder Hacks.**  Founder.hacks is all about tools, hacks and street fight economics. We are talking about the things we use to build and run businesses that are not taught in business school but are used every day. 

**2nd Wednesday of each month - Founder Social.**  Founder.social is all about social enterprise.  Learn about creating businesses that address social and ecological issues.

**3rd Wednesday of each month - Founder Expert.**  Founder.expert is about quality Q&A time with someone who is a leader in specific fields related to running your business such as law or accounting. You'll get to ask an expert about tricky issues you’re dealing with in your business.

**4th Wednesday of each month - Founder Stories.**  Founder.stories is all about stories from founders from our region, their journey, their experience and their learnings. 

**5th Wednesday of each month - Founder Drinks.**  Not all months are created equal.  Sometimes there will be 4 meetups a month, sometimes there will be 5.  When there is a 5th week we'll meet for a drink and a chat about what's going on in your business.  Bring your thoughts, grab a drink and bounce your ideas off 

*Our schedule is flexible, and we have regular special events.  The best way of staying up to date with the changing schedule is by signing up on our **[Meetups Page](https://www.meetup.com/localfoundation/)** *
