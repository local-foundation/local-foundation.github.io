Startup Weekend in Nelson is in it's 3rd year and we are super stoked to have a few of the teams from the first Startup Weekend still going. We have seen many of you come through other events throughout the years and we are so proud to see that Startup Weekend has had a significant impact to many people in the Nelson region.

So, what is it all about? In short, take a weekend off, it's going to be rainy anyway, and join other people learning and having fun building a company in a weekend. We often hear "I have nothing to offer" or "This is not for me" from those that after the weekend are the most keen to carry on realising their ideas and coming around to our follow up events. If you want to learn more about yourself and about a fun way to learn for a weekend with a lot of fun people then Startup Weekend is for you - even if you never thought of yourself as an entrepreneur and the word "startup" does not really resonate with you.

We will guarantee you fun, tons of learning that you can apply in day to day life and maybe we even get one or two companies that carry on.
